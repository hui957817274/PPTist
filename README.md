# üé® super-ppt
> An online presentation (slideshow) application based on Vue3.x + TypeScript, which restores most of the common functions of Office PowerPoint, and supports text, pictures, shapes, lines, charts, tables, videos, audio, and formulas. Element type, each element has a high degree of editability, and supports rich shortcut keys and right-click menus, supports exporting local PPTX files, supports basic editing and preview on mobile terminals, and supports PWA. You can build your own online slideshow application on this basis.

<b>Online experience address: [https://supernovate07.github.io/super-ppt/](https://supernovate07.github.io/super-ppt/)</b>


# üëÄ Front Row Tips
1. The goal of this project is to create an "online slideshow application", not a "low-code platform", "H5 editor" or "picture editing tool".
2. The target audience of this project is <b>developers who have the development needs of „ÄêWeb Slideshow„Äë</b>, the link provided is just a demonstration address, and no online service is provided. You should not use this project directly as a tool, nor does it support one-click deployment.
If you just need a service or tool, you can choose more excellent and mature products, such as: [Graphite Documentation](https://shimo.im/), [Kingsoft Documentation](https://www.kdocs.cn/ ), [Slidev](https://sli.dev/), [revealjs](https://revealjs.com/), etc.
3. This project is a DOM-based rendering solution, which has the advantage of being simple and easy to use. However, compared with the Canvas rendering solution, there will be a certain gap in performance in complex scenes, so if you have high performance requirements, this project may not be a good choice/reference direction.
4. Some [FAQs](https://github.com/supernovate07/super-ppt/blob/master/doc/Q&A.md) are summarized here. When submitting Issues and PR for the first time, be sure to read this document in advance .

# üíª Contributing Code
First of all, I would like to thank the friends who pay attention to this project. Everyone who is interested in this project is very welcome to contribute code.

### The specific reference is as follows:
- fork the source code, download it locally and run the project
- Add/modify code
- <b>Completely self-test the changes (this is very important)</b>
- Submit the modification to Github after confirming that it is correct
- Submit a Pull Request

### Also note that:
- Each Pull Request should not submit too much code, and must explain the specific purpose of this change, such as: fixing a bug, optimizing a method, etc., to facilitate Code Review;
- For bug fixes, this Pull Request should be associated with the corresponding bug issue to let others know that the problem has been fixed;
- For larger new functions, you need to submit Issues first, such as "add XXX function", and then start working after confirming that the function is necessary to be added;
- For some subjective style and interaction logic adjustments: such as the use of colors and icons, the increase or decrease of some preset configurations, etc., they are generally not approved. But it can be discussed in Issues;
- Others such as simple code optimization, document correction, etc., as long as the modification is reasonable, it will be accepted.

Thanks to every contributor here.
